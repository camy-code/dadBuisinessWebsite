# Hello! 
Hello, this is my template for when I want to build a website with react and MUI. This template is fairly simple but it saves about a hour of figuring out how layout works again as I seem to always relearn that! 

Can clone this directly and navigate directory and run ```npm start```

and things should run. In the case that some imports are missing please run.
```
npm install @mui/system @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc
```
As well as: 
```
npm install react-router-dom
```
Happy coding! And make sure to drink water. Anyone is welcome to use this if it helps them!
